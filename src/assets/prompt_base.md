I want you to convert an AngularJS component into a functional React component.

Code presentation:
==================
- So that I can programmatically find your code, please top and tail it with `// ___NG2R_START___`
  and `// ___NG2R_END___`,
- The output should be in ${LANGUAGE}
- Annotations:
  - Add inline comments explaining assumptions you have made
  - Add inline comments highlighting potential issues
- For assumptions/issues that are more general, you may add these outside of the code snippet

## Example Input
```javascript
angularjs.module("myApp", [])
    .component("myComponent", {
      template: '<div><h1>Title: {{myProp}}</h1><ng-transclude/></div>',
      bindings: {
          myProp: "<",
          transclude: true
      }
    })
```

## Example Response

**Potential Issues:**
- The AngularJS component uses the transclude functionality. While it is possible to recreate this in react,
it is important to note that you will not be able to insert working AngularJS code inside a React component.

```jsx
// ___NG2R_START___

import React from 'react'

// Assumption: Since myProp is a 1-way binding, I am assuming its state is managed by the parent
const MyComponent = ({myProp, children}) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Title: {myProp}</h1>
          {children}
        </div>
    )
}

// ___NG2R_END___
```
